        <h2>Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction</h2>
        <h3>Reaction</h3>
        <p>
            Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction is a chemical reaction and the only common element in these oscillators is the inclusion of bromine and an acid.
            The mechanism for this reaction is very complex and is thought to involve around 18 different steps which have been the subject of a number of research papers.

        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
                The discovery of the phenomenon is credited to <b><i>Boris Pavlovich Belousov</i></b>, what he discovered it in 1951. He made two attempts to publish his 
				finding, but was rejected on the grounds that he could not explain his results to the satisfaction of the editors of the journals to which he submitted his results.
                But Simon El'evich Shnoll encouraged Belousov to continue his efforts to publish his results and in 1959 his work was finally published. After Belousov's 
				publication, Schnoll gave the project in 1961 to a graduate student, <b><i>Anatol Zhabotinsky</i></b>, who investigated the reaction sequence in detail. 
				However, the results of these men's work were still not widely disseminated, and were not known in the West until a conference in Prague in 1968.
